1
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:36,155
<i>This is Berk.</i>

2
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:40,659
<i>So far off the map that</i>
<i>it might as well not exist.</i>

3
00:00:42,028 --> 00:00:43,329
<i>My village?</i>

4
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:45,597
<i>In a word, sturdy.</i>

5
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:47,367
<i>It's been here for generations,</i>

6
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,869
<i>but every single building</i>
<i>is new.</i>

7
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:51,737
<i>The air is crisp,</i>
<i>the water is clean,</i>

8
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:54,506
<i>and the views are nothing</i>
<i>to complain about.</i>

9
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:57,542
<i>The only downsides</i>
<i>are the pests.</i>

10
00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:08,254
<i>You see, most places</i>
<i>have mice or mosquitoes.</i>

11
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:09,889
<i>We have...</i>

12
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:17,763
Dragons.

13
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:23,802
<i>Most people would leave.</i>

14
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,238
<i>Not us.</i>

15
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:26,738
<i>We're Vikings.</i>

16
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:29,175
<i>We don't run from fights.</i>
<i>We start them.</i>

17
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:30,809
-Hey! Hiccup!
-Evening.

18
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:31,677
Go home!

19
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:33,379
I will just as soon as I, uh...

20
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:35,915
You're in the way again!

21
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,219
Hiccup, play dead!

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,021
<i>You see, dragons have been</i>

23
00:01:42,088 --> 00:01:43,389
<i>a bit of a problem.</i>

24
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:45,757
<i>Here and, well, everywhere.</i>

25
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:49,095
<i>So we decided to take</i>
<i>the fight to them.</i>

26
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:52,031
<i>How's that working out for us?</i>

27
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:53,732
<i>Eh...</i>

28
00:01:57,636 --> 00:01:59,504
-Whoa!
-What are you doing?

29
00:01:59,604 --> 00:02:02,241
What is he doing out again?

30
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:03,742
Get inside. Go on.

31
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:06,478
<i>That's Stoick the Vast,</i>

32
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:08,014
<i>chief of the tribe.</i>

33
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:11,250
<i>They say, when he was a baby,</i>

34
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:14,320
<i>he popped a dragon's head</i>
<i>clean off its shoulders.</i>

35
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,989
<i>Do I believe it?</i>

36
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:19,624
<i>-Yes, I do.</i>
-What have we got?

37
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:23,396
Gronckles, Nadders,
Zipplebacks, Skrills.

38
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:25,231
Snorti spotted
a Monstrous Nightmare.

39
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:26,432
Any Night Furies?

40
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:27,867
None so far, Chief.

41
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,701
Good.

42
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:31,503
-Follow me.
-Right, Chief.

43
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,572
Come on, you wretches!

44
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:35,607
You heard him. Come on, lads.

45
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:40,545
Oh. Out again?

46
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,514
Just pretend I'm not even here.

47
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:44,217
I'll be in and out
before you can say...

48
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,352
Not so fast.

49
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:47,652
Come on, please.

50
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:49,721
<i>The meathead with attitude</i>

51
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:51,491
<i>and interchangeable hands</i>
<i>is Gobber.</i>

52
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:52,791
Here. Go on.

53
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:54,826
<i>I've been his apprentice</i>

54
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:56,661
<i>-ever since I was little.</i>
-I'm keeping my eye on you.

55
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:58,197
I'm not even supposed
to be out here.

56
00:02:58,297 --> 00:03:00,900
Ha! Since when did that
ever stop you?

57
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:04,871
Guard the food stores.

58
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:07,006
-Aye, Chief.
-Protect the livestock.

59
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:08,408
Aye, Stoick.

60
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:10,076
And keep an ear out
for Night Furies.

61
00:03:19,352 --> 00:03:20,953
Hammer.

62
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:29,661
Fire brigade!

63
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,364
<i>Ah, the fire brigade.</i>

64
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:33,266
<i>Berk's cool kids.</i>

65
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:36,469
<i>They get to be out</i>
<i>in the action.</i>

66
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:38,703
Guys, out of the way!

67
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:40,540
<i>But they're nothing</i>

68
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,874
<i>without their captain,</i>

69
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:44,877
<i>the shining star</i>
<i>of our generation.</i>

70
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:47,880
<i>A-Amazing without even trying.</i>

71
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:50,715
<i>The one that smokes them all.</i>

72
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,187
<i>Astrid.</i>

73
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,068
What?

74
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:10,735
Uh...

75
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:13,239
Shouldn't you be in bed?

76
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:17,009
Come on, back to work.

77
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,778
You know,
I need to get out there.

78
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,813
Show my stuff, make my mark.

79
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:24,217
You've made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.

80
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:26,618
Give me two minutes.
I'll-I'll take down a dragon.

81
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,489
My life will get
infinitely better.

82
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:30,789
I might even get a girlfriend.

83
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,391
There's a Zippleback
behind you!

84
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:33,758
Astrid?

85
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:35,461
But she's a real Viking.

86
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:36,761
You can't wield a hammer.

87
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:38,797
You can't swing an axe.

88
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:40,699
You can't even throw
one of these.

89
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:43,002
See, but this...
this will throw it for me.

90
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:45,271
-Oh, another one.
-It's fully redesigned.

91
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:46,939
It-it's...

92
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,474
-Whoa!
-Whew!

93
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:50,409
It's, uh...

94
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,445
double-barreled.

95
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:54,981
You see, this right here...
this is what I'm talking about.

96
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:57,550
Okay, this is a mild cal...
mild calibration issue.

97
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,152
If you ever want
to get out there

98
00:04:59,185 --> 00:05:02,355
and start fighting dragons,
you've got to stop all of...

99
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:03,923
all of this.

100
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:05,525
You just gestured to all of me.

101
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,194
Yeah. Stop being all of you.

102
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:09,962
Oh...

103
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:10,930
Oh, yeah.

104
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,665
You, sir, are playing
a dangerous game.

105
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:15,767
Keeping this contained?

106
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:17,537
There will be consequences.

107
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,940
Well, I will take my chances.

108
00:05:21,673 --> 00:05:24,210
Sword-- sharpen. Now.

109
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:28,614
<i>One day, I'll get out there.</i>

110
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:32,817
<i>Because killing a dragon</i>
<i>is everything around here.</i>

111
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:35,588
<i>Gronckles are tough.</i>

112
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:38,690
<i>Taking one down</i>
<i>would at least get me noticed.</i>

113
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,662
<i>A Zippleback?</i>

114
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:45,064
<i>Exotic, exciting.</i>

115
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:48,833
<i>Two heads, twice the status.</i>

116
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:51,237
<i>Lopping off a Nadder's head</i>

117
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:53,206
<i>would definitely show them</i>
<i>I belong.</i>

118
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:00,613
Come on, lads!

119
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:02,148
They found the sheep.

120
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:05,084
Then let loose
with everything we've got.

121
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:10,556
<i>And then there's</i>

122
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:12,358
<i>the Monstrous Nightmare.</i>

123
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:15,361
Reload!

124
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:17,863
<i>Only the best Vikings</i>
<i>go after those.</i>

125
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:25,204
<i>But the ultimate prize</i>

126
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:28,773
<i>is the dragon</i>
<i>that no one has ever seen.</i>

127
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:31,143
<i>-We call it the...</i>
-Night Fury!

128
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:32,979
Jump!

129
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:38,817
And we've got a Night Fury.

130
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:42,622
Never steals food,
never shows itself.

131
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:44,756
And never misses.

132
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,195
Time for old Gobber
to take over.

133
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,633
Stay put here.

134
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,134
Here. I'm serious.

135
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:57,536
<i>No one has</i>
<i>ever killed a Night Fury.</i>

136
00:06:57,637 --> 00:06:59,272
Attack!

137
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:01,907
<i>That's why</i>
<i>I'm going to be the first.</i>

138
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:05,278
-You again? Get back inside!
-I'll make a point of it.

139
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:07,880
You're going to get
yourself killed, Hiccup!

140
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,049
I know! Sorry.

141
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:17,156
Here, give me that.

142
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,262
Mind yourself!

143
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:26,265
This Nadder still has
some fire in it.

144
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:38,144
Come on.

145
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:40,812
Give me something to shoot at.
Give me something to shoot at.

146
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:44,450
Come on, show yourself.

147
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:58,830
I hit it.

148
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:05,638
I hit it!

149
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:08,107
Did anybody see that?

150
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:10,976
Except for you.

151
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:16,115
Oh, gods.

152
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:20,720
Spitelout,
do not let that escape.

153
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:22,655
Thanks a lot.

154
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:49,081
You're all out.

155
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:52,118
Let's see what else
you're made of.

156
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:12,004
Aye, that's what I thought.

157
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,642
<i>Oh, and there's one</i>
<i>more thing to know.</i>

158
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:21,180
Look out!

159
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,292
Sorry, Dad.

160
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:37,563
Watch out!

161
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:50,877
Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.

162
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:53,914
Dad, this isn't like
any other time.

163
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,614
I mean, I really hit one.

164
00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:58,117
Aye, a dragon
no one's ever seen.

165
00:09:58,217 --> 00:10:00,286
Because it uses night
as its camouflage.

166
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:02,555
If you squint, you can see it
blotting out the stars.

167
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:05,458
-That's how I shot it down.
-Stop!

168
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:07,626
Stop.

169
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:11,397
Every time you step outside,
disaster happens.

170
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:15,835
Can you not see
that I have bigger problems?

171
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:17,203
Winter is almost here,

172
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:19,772
and I have an entire village
to feed.

173
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,540
Between you and me,
the village could do

174
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:23,175
with a little less feeding.

175
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:25,978
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

176
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:28,882
Why can't you follow
the simplest orders?

177
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:31,150
Because I can't stop myself.

178
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,254
Okay? I see a dragon,
and I have to just... kill it.

179
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:37,590
You know, i-it's...
it's who I am.

180
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:41,794
You are many things, son,

181
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,530
but a dragon killer
is not one of them.

182
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:49,970
Get back to the house.

183
00:10:50,135 --> 00:10:52,137
Make sure he stays there.

184
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:54,540
How much can one person mess up?

185
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:57,209
Anyone else would have been
booted off the island by now.

186
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:00,246
I guess being son of the chief
has its privileges.

187
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,682
If not for the chief, though...

188
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:08,521
Anyway, my dad's
super proud of me, so...

189
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:11,023
Dad, I was just talking...

190
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:12,758
Don't talk to me in public.

191
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,028
You know, I really did hit one.

192
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:17,730
Of course you did, Hiccup.

193
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,999
He never listens.

194
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:20,432
Well, that runs in the family.

195
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:22,434
And-and when he does,

196
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,371
it's always with
some disappointed scowl,

197
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:27,072
like somebody forgot
the meat in the stew.

198
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:28,507
I've seen that look.

199
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:33,212
Oi. You're thinking
about this all wrong, eh?

200
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:35,347
It's not so much
what you look like.

201
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:38,183
It's what's inside of you
he can't stand.

202
00:11:39,084 --> 00:11:41,186
Thank you for summing that up.

203
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,390
W-Wait. The point is...

204
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:47,426
stop trying so hard
to be something you're not.

205
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:51,597
I just want to be
one of you guys.

206
00:11:58,671 --> 00:12:00,205
I know you do.

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,836
No one said it would be easy!

208
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,306
But may I remind you,

209
00:12:34,406 --> 00:12:39,211
we are all descendants
of the finest dragon fighters

210
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:42,481
from everywhere
Vikings have traveled,

211
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:45,184
who gathered here
because they knew

212
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:47,720
that we were within
spitting distance

213
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:50,522
of a key dragon's nest.

214
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,325
If we can just take it,

215
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,862
we can wipe out the devils
for good.

216
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:58,230
Take it? We can't even find it.

217
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,365
Exactly.

218
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:00,967
This nest is starting to sound

219
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:02,534
more and more like a fairy tale.

220
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:03,669
We're exhausted.

221
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:05,170
And what do we have
to show for it, eh?

222
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,772
Nothing!

223
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:07,974
We have purpose.

224
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,909
Oh, come on.

225
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,312
We are the warriors of Berk,

226
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:17,149
the roughest, toughest tribe
this side of the sun.

227
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:20,653
No?

228
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:22,521
Phlegma.

229
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:26,993
We watched you take down
a Zippleback singlehandedly.

230
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:29,294
I mean, sure, you lost your leg
in the process,

231
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:32,197
but you came out on top,
didn't you?

232
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:33,465
-Well...
-Yes, you did.

233
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:37,403
Retcha, your people came
from the Far East.

234
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:40,839
Fungi, yours all the way
from-from the Silk Road.

235
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,641
Loogi, your people came

236
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,577
from the sunbaked coasts
of Bláland.

237
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:46,645
And look at us.

238
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:49,181
We're still here.
We're still fighting.

239
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:52,351
We're still watching
each other's backs.

240
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:55,155
So are we really gonna pack up
and go home

241
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,123
while these bloody beasts

242
00:13:57,256 --> 00:14:00,894
are still a threat
to all of our lands?

243
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,261
Is that who we are?

244
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:04,097
-No.
-Is it?

245
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:05,698
-No.
-Is it?!

246
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:06,699
No!

247
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:07,934
Is it?!

248
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:09,702
No!

249
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:10,970
Is it?

250
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:13,205
Uh, no, Chief, I guess not.

251
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:15,474
That's what I thought.

252
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:21,747
Elder Gothi, give us a sign.

253
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:24,884
Do we stand a chance
of finding the nest

254
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:26,618
before the ice sets in?

255
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,773
Then that's all I need.

256
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:53,079
Back into the fog we go.

257
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:54,346
All right, everyone.

258
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:56,749
Prepare the ships!

259
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:12,165
Do I take my bucket hand
for when they burn our ships

260
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:15,634
or my swimming hand
for when they sink them?

261
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,407
Not so fast, Gobber.

262
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:26,946
I don't have time to train
this year's recruits,

263
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:28,114
so you'll do it.

264
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,681
Ah, the old rite of passage.

265
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:32,185
Hiccup's just come of age,
hasn't he?

266
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:34,187
I meant the others.

267
00:15:34,353 --> 00:15:36,588
Yeah, so while I'm busy,
he'll c-cover the stall.

268
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:39,424
Molten steel,
razor-sharp blades,

269
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:40,492
lots of time on his hands.

270
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:41,727
What could possibly go wrong?

271
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:43,963
Oh, what am I gonna do
with him, Gobber?

272
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:46,199
Stick him in training.

273
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:48,101
No. I'm serious.

274
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:49,635
Yeah, so am I.

275
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:52,172
The kid wants this
more than anything.

276
00:15:52,238 --> 00:15:53,940
Believe it or not,

277
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,276
that young man actually
wants to make you proud.

278
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:58,945
But he's got a mind of his own.

279
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,047
Gets that from his mother.

280
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:02,215
Look what happened to her.

281
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:03,715
Yeah, 'cause Valka was
the stubborn one.

282
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:05,717
-See, when I was a boy...
-Oh, here we go.

283
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:07,921
I-I followed orders.
Right? I worked hard.

284
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:11,224
Because I believed
in what a-a Viking could do.

285
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:13,293
Crush mountains,

286
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:16,395
level forests, tame seas.

287
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:20,432
I knew what I was
and what I had to become.

288
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,703
Hiccup is... he's not that boy.

289
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:29,242
What chance does he have
of following in my footsteps?

290
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:30,877
Yeah.

291
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:37,917
You can't stop him, Stoick.

292
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:39,986
You can only prepare him.

293
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:41,420
Because the truth is

294
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:43,755
we aren't always gonna
be around to protect him.

295
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:46,625
He's gonna get out there again.

296
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:49,595
He's probably out there now.

297
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:24,630
How could I lose
an entire dragon?!

298
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:26,458
I did it.

299
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:29,594
I did it!

300
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:41,473
Oh, why couldn't you
have been dead?

301
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:45,744
Now I have to kill you.

302
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:44,696
Hiccup.

303
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:48,134
Dad. Uh...

304
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:52,737
Look, I need
to talk to you, Dad.

305
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,143
I need to speak
with you, too, son.

306
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:00,745
I've decided I don't want

307
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:01,780
-to fight dragons.
-I think it's time

308
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:02,548
you learn to fight dragons.

309
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:03,715
What?

310
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:04,884
Well, you go first.

311
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:06,419
No, no, no, no.
You-you go first.

312
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:09,188
You get your wish.

313
00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:10,490
Dragon training.

314
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:12,158
Start in the morning.

315
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:15,627
Oh, man, I really
should've gone first.

316
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,696
You know,
'cause I-I was thinking,

317
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:20,233
we have a surplus
of dragon-fighting Vikings,

318
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,235
but do we have enough
bread-making Vikings or...

319
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:23,936
You'll need this.

320
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,373
Dad... I don't want
to fight dragons.

321
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,574
Come on.

322
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,443
Yes, you do.

323
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,044
No, let me rephrase.

324
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:33,613
I can't kill dragons.

325
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:34,947
But you will.

326
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:37,617
No, I'm very extra sure
that I won't.

327
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:40,785
It's time, Hiccup.

328
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:45,491
Uh... can you not hear me?

329
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:47,927
Can you not hear me?!

330
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:57,503
The Trial of Flame is
where Vikings are made.

331
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,674
Where heroes are forged,
where future chiefs are born.

332
00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:06,212
I... I'm none of those things.

333
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,016
I'm not like you, Dad.

334
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:16,821
Listen.

335
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:22,794
When you carry this axe,

336
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:25,198
you carry all of us with you.

337
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:26,933
Which means you walk like us,

338
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:30,503
you talk like us,
you think like us.

339
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,240
No more of... this.

340
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:37,376
You just gestured to all of me.

341
00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:38,743
Deal?

342
00:22:38,878 --> 00:22:40,346
This conversation is feeling
very one-sided.

343
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:42,982
Deal?

344
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:46,219
Deal.

345
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:47,987
Good.

346
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:55,361
Train hard.

347
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,365
I'll be back.

348
00:23:02,702 --> 00:23:04,370
Probably.

349
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,977
And I'll be here.

350
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:14,113
Maybe.

351
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:22,021
Welcome to the Trial of Flame.

352
00:23:35,434 --> 00:23:38,671
The moment
we've all been waiting for.

353
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:40,906
I just got to pick a spot
for my statue.

354
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:43,142
It's so much bigger
from down here.

355
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:45,544
Can you guys believe
we're actually standing here?

356
00:23:45,645 --> 00:23:48,981
This is where Chief Greybile
slew the Whispering Death.

357
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:50,349
Yeah, and it's where
Chief Tuffnut

358
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:51,651
will slay everything else.

359
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:52,985
-Watch and learn.
-Man, I can't wait

360
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:55,021
to get some
legendary war wounds!

361
00:23:55,121 --> 00:23:57,789
Yeah, like a nasty gash
right across my face.

362
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,025
-Call me boring...
-Boring.

363
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:00,693
...but I'm just excited to see

364
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:03,129
some real live dragons up close.

365
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:05,998
You know, I could do without
the permanent injuries and...

366
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:07,433
Oh, where's the glory in that?

367
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:09,635
Yeah, it's only fun
if you get a scar out of it.

368
00:24:09,735 --> 00:24:12,038
I know, right?

369
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:14,040
Pain.

370
00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:15,007
Love it.

371
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:17,076
Oh, great. Who let him in?

372
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:19,912
Mm, I guess Daddy pulled
some strings, huh?

373
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:21,314
Aren't you two, like,
a little old to be here?

374
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:22,847
-Ouch. -Wait, what did you say,
whippersnapper?

375
00:24:22,948 --> 00:24:24,816
What did you say?
Can you say it again?

376
00:24:25,718 --> 00:24:26,986
Yeah, touchy subject.

377
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,954
They've flunked dragon training
a few times.

378
00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:31,023
Um, it was four times, actually.

379
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:32,824
Yeah, and it's called
being held back.

380
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:34,826
As in too valuable to let go of.

381
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,563
Real sensitive, Hiccup.

382
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:38,830
Nice name, by the way.

383
00:24:38,964 --> 00:24:40,599
Your name is Snotlout.

384
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:41,801
Exactly.

385
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:44,036
It's a manly Viking name.

386
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:45,271
Translates from
the ancient texts as

387
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:47,106
"one who beateth the snot
out of a..."

388
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:48,674
Shut up.

389
00:24:48,774 --> 00:24:50,343
Let's get started.

390
00:24:50,443 --> 00:24:52,178
Bloody kids.

391
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:56,282
You are now the latest to join
this time-honored tradition.

392
00:24:56,382 --> 00:24:58,751
Every toe biter
born into our tribe

393
00:24:58,884 --> 00:25:00,619
must one day survive this arena

394
00:25:00,653 --> 00:25:04,090
if they ever hope to do battle
alongside the rest of us.

395
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:07,126
It will be grueling.

396
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:13,532
And it will be
very, very dangerous.

397
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,270
But whoever does best will win
the title of Top Slayer.

398
00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:22,174
And with it...

399
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:25,745
And with it, the honor
of killing their first dragon

400
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:28,080
in front of the entire village.

401
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,282
There is no greater glory.

402
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:32,918
What?

403
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:34,487
Hiccup already killed
a Night Fury,

404
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,022
so does that, like, what,
disqualify him or...

405
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:39,558
Oh, ignore him.

406
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:41,327
You're skinny.

407
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,828
You're weak.

408
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:44,897
That'll make you
less of a target.

409
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,499
They'll see you
as slim pickings.

410
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:47,868
Not worth the effort.

411
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:51,003
They'll go after the more, uh...

412
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:53,038
Viking-like teens instead.

413
00:25:54,673 --> 00:25:57,610
Behind these doors are just
a few of the many species

414
00:25:57,676 --> 00:25:58,944
you will learn to fight.

415
00:25:58,978 --> 00:26:01,480
The Deadly Nadder.

416
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:03,048
Attack eight, armor 16.

417
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:04,083
The Hideous Zippleback.

418
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,518
Plus 11 stealth, times two.

419
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:07,052
The Monstrous Nightmare.

420
00:26:07,153 --> 00:26:09,054
-Firepower 15.
-The Terrible Terror.

421
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:11,190
-Attack eight, venom 12!
-Will you stop that!

422
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,193
You big bag of wool.

423
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:19,198
And finally,
the gruesome Gronckle.

424
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:21,434
Jaw strength eight.

425
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,907
Uh, hey, big guy,
aren't you gonna, like,

426
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,008
teach us something first?

427
00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:32,077
I believe in learning
on the job.

428
00:26:35,214 --> 00:26:37,616
Today is all about defense.

429
00:26:39,118 --> 00:26:40,786
If you get blasted, you're out.

430
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,421
Or, you know, dead.

431
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:44,156
So what's the first thing
you're gonna need?

432
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,558
-A shield!
-Shield, yes. Go.

433
00:26:45,624 --> 00:26:47,526
-Out of my way.
-That one's mine!

434
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:50,496
Shield is your most important
piece of equipment.

435
00:26:51,831 --> 00:26:55,234
If you have to choose between
a weapon and a shield...

436
00:26:55,936 --> 00:26:57,503
Just put it down.

437
00:26:57,603 --> 00:26:59,071
Take the shield.

438
00:26:59,104 --> 00:26:59,972
-Give it!
-Mine, mine, mine!

439
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:01,474
Find your own shield!

440
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:08,848
Ruffnut, Tuffnut, you're out.

441
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:12,418
Shields are good
for another thing: noise.

442
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:15,387
Make plenty of it
to throw off the dragon's aim.

443
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:21,227
Remember, all dragons have
a limited number of blasts.

444
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:23,028
How many does a Gronckle have?

445
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:24,730
Ooh, ooh! Six!

446
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,165
Six, yes.

447
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:27,934
That's one for each of you.

448
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,568
Although, interesting tidbit,

449
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:32,404
rocks from different regions
vary in mineral comp...

450
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:37,443
What are you do...
What are you doing?

451
00:27:37,543 --> 00:27:40,145
What are you doing?
Get in there!

452
00:27:41,146 --> 00:27:43,148
Fishlegs, you're out.

453
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:45,651
-Four shots left.
-Yeah.

454
00:27:45,784 --> 00:27:47,921
We're pretty much gonna be
the stars of this thing.

455
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,288
Almost like we were meant
to be together.

456
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:51,056
It's an elimination game,
genius.

457
00:27:51,156 --> 00:27:53,259
There's only one Top Slayer.

458
00:27:56,362 --> 00:27:58,597
Snotlout, you're done.

459
00:27:58,731 --> 00:28:00,032
Three shots.

460
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:02,535
Looks like it's just
you and me, huh?

461
00:28:02,635 --> 00:28:04,403
Nope. Just me.

462
00:28:05,037 --> 00:28:07,306
Hey! Eyes on me!

463
00:28:14,346 --> 00:28:16,815
Yes. Well done, Astrid.

464
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:19,485
Two shots left.

465
00:28:19,618 --> 00:28:21,053
Oh, come on.

466
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:24,356
Hiccup, you're out.

467
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,791
-One shot left.
-Hey, watch it!

468
00:28:27,861 --> 00:28:30,062
Hiccup!

469
00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:34,500
End of lesson.

470
00:28:39,104 --> 00:28:41,607
Back to bed,
you overgrown sausage.

471
00:28:48,347 --> 00:28:54,453
Remember, a dragon
will always, always...

472
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:58,190
...go for the kill.

473
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:14,239
So, why didn't you?

474
00:30:19,873 --> 00:30:21,540
Okay.

475
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,460
Huh.

476
00:31:30,442 --> 00:31:32,478
Let's review, shall we?

477
00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:34,948
Where did Astrid go wrong
in the ring today?

478
00:31:35,048 --> 00:31:36,515
I mistimed my somersault dive.

479
00:31:36,615 --> 00:31:38,350
It was sloppy.
It threw off my reverse tumble.

480
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,419
-Uh, yeah. We noticed.
-Hey.

481
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,189
Back off my girl. All right?

482
00:31:43,322 --> 00:31:44,556
-She's trying her best.
-Yeah.

483
00:31:44,656 --> 00:31:46,558
Don't beat yourself up.
You'll get it.

484
00:31:46,725 --> 00:31:48,360
Just follow my lead next time.

485
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,496
Astrid's right.

486
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:52,498
You've got to be tough
on yourselves.

487
00:31:52,564 --> 00:31:55,267
All it takes is one weak link.

488
00:31:56,835 --> 00:31:59,371
You made it, then?

489
00:32:00,472 --> 00:32:02,708
You got to start
taking this seriously,

490
00:32:02,808 --> 00:32:04,843
because we are living
in a battleground.

491
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:07,881
And in case you haven't noticed,
the other side is winning.

492
00:32:07,914 --> 00:32:10,349
You're gonna need
every advantage you can get.

493
00:32:10,449 --> 00:32:13,119
So, if you haven't done
your homework,

494
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:14,921
allow me to present to you...

495
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:21,660
...the Book of Dragons.

496
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:26,298
Everything we know
about every dragon we know of.

497
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,135
Each of your tribes
brought their wisdom

498
00:32:29,202 --> 00:32:31,436
and experience to these pages.

499
00:32:32,604 --> 00:32:34,773
It's our most hallowed
possession.

500
00:32:37,076 --> 00:32:40,079
No dragon raids tonight,
so study up.

501
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:42,648
You mean read?

502
00:32:42,748 --> 00:32:44,650
I've read it
like a hundred times.

503
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,319
There's a Scauldron that sprays
your face with boiling water.

504
00:32:47,352 --> 00:32:50,190
And then there's, um, another...

505
00:32:50,322 --> 00:32:51,991
Why would I read words

506
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:55,360
when I can just kill the stuff
the words tell me stuff about?

507
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,762
Right? I mean, like,
I'm the kind of guy

508
00:32:56,795 --> 00:32:58,630
that other guys
write word books about.

509
00:32:58,764 --> 00:33:00,699
Nice.

510
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:02,601
-Boys!
-Don't worry, though.

511
00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:05,138
I'm here for all of your
dragon-related inquiries, okay?

512
00:33:05,238 --> 00:33:06,505
Theories, stats.

513
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:09,741
I've even made, um, cards, um...

514
00:33:11,244 --> 00:33:12,477
You can ask me anything.

515
00:33:12,578 --> 00:33:13,412
-Stop following me.
-Here.

516
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:14,546
How about now? Try me now.

517
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:16,748
Absolutely not.

518
00:33:24,324 --> 00:33:26,192
So...

519
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:29,595
sounds like a gruesome,
grisly, good time, huh?

520
00:33:30,263 --> 00:33:31,297
Read it.

521
00:33:31,463 --> 00:33:33,599
Y-You know, uh...

522
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:36,002
maybe they're not as bad
as we think they are.

523
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,772
Are you actually insane,
or do you just act that way?

524
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:43,609
Is-is there...
is there a third option?

525
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,946
Wiping out dragons
is why we're here.

526
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:49,848
It's why the best
of our tribes came together.

527
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:53,319
Because yes, dragons are
as bad as we think.

528
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:55,121
Y-Yeah, I-I know.
I'm just saying,

529
00:33:55,154 --> 00:33:56,755
maybe we're part of the problem.

530
00:33:56,822 --> 00:34:00,792
You know, moving in on
their lands, eating their food.

531
00:34:05,831 --> 00:34:07,166
Wow.

532
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,168
You live in
a different world, don't you?

533
00:34:09,302 --> 00:34:10,702
What?

534
00:34:10,802 --> 00:34:13,239
Just coast by,
taking it all for granted.

535
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:14,606
Well, I don't think that...

536
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:15,707
Never having to work
for anything,

537
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:17,277
never struggling
to get a foot up.

538
00:34:17,343 --> 00:34:19,245
Well, guess what.

539
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:21,413
I come from nothing.

540
00:34:21,513 --> 00:34:25,450
No chief for a dad,
no handouts, no excuses.

541
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,053
I'm not afraid of hard work.

542
00:34:27,086 --> 00:34:28,855
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to get the job done,

543
00:34:28,955 --> 00:34:30,990
which, in this case,
means wiping out the dragons

544
00:34:31,124 --> 00:34:32,691
for the good of everyone.

545
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,826
Yeah.

546
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,063
You know what else?

547
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:39,831
I'm-I'm afraid... afraid to ask.

548
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:45,570
I've got my eye
on that big house of yours.

549
00:34:45,671 --> 00:34:47,806
I'm gonna be chief one day.

550
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:51,210
I-I don't doubt it.

551
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:54,479
Actually, I think
my dad would be thrilled.

552
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:56,382
Besides, you're the kid
he always hoped for.

553
00:34:56,548 --> 00:34:59,118
Instead, he got...

554
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:00,819
all this.

555
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:04,857
Stay out of my way, Hiccup.

556
00:35:20,505 --> 00:35:22,607
"Dragon classifications.

557
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:26,012
"Strike class. Fear class.
Mystery class.

558
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:30,216
"Thunderdrum.

559
00:35:30,316 --> 00:35:32,684
"When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound

560
00:35:32,784 --> 00:35:34,686
"that can kill a man
at close range.

561
00:35:34,786 --> 00:35:36,923

562
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:38,557

"The unholy offspring

571

Never engage this dragon."

572
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:18,064
I can almost smell them.

573
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:31,010
Take us in to Helheim's Gate.

574
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,945
Here we go again.

575
00:36:33,046 --> 00:36:35,081
Hard to port!

576
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:39,085
Hard to port!

577
00:36:41,586 --> 00:36:45,124
Set the oars! Furl the sails!

578
00:36:45,191 --> 00:36:46,325
All together.

579
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:48,061
Come on.

580
00:36:48,194 --> 00:36:49,929
Higher.

581
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,377
We're not alone!

582
00:37:38,511 --> 00:37:40,046
-Look up!
-Watch your heads!

583
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:57,130
Turn back!

584
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,632
They're everywhere!

585
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:04,803
Hey, I just, uh...
I just happened to notice

586
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:07,907
that the book had nothing
on Night Furies.

587
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:10,842
Is there maybe, like,
like, another book?

588
00:38:10,943 --> 00:38:12,378
Maybe, like,
a Night Fury pamph...

589
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,515
Focus, Hiccup.

590
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:17,782
You're not even trying.

591
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:20,719
Today is about attack.

592
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:22,989
Nadders are quick
and light on their feet.

593
00:38:23,122 --> 00:38:26,559
Your job is to be quicker
and lighter.

594
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,202
Sorry.

595
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:42,441
I'm really beginning to
question your teaching methods!

596
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:43,643
Look for its blind spot.

597
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:44,809
Every dragon has one.

598
00:38:44,944 --> 00:38:48,813
Find it, hide in it,
then strike.

599
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:53,052
Do you ever bathe?

600
00:38:53,152 --> 00:38:56,522
If you don't like it, go find
your own blind spot. Go!

601
00:38:57,056 --> 00:38:58,558
Blind spot, yes.

602
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,326
Deaf spot, not so much.

603
00:39:01,793 --> 00:39:03,963
I am hurt. I am very much hurt.

604
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:06,399
So, how does one sneak up
on a Night Fury?

605
00:39:06,499 --> 00:39:09,068
No one has ever met one
and lived to tell the tale.

606
00:39:09,168 --> 00:39:10,835
-Now, get in there!
-Yeah, I-I know.

607
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,971
I-I'm just saying, like,

608
00:39:12,038 --> 00:39:14,440
-how would...
-Hiccup.

609
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,108
Down.

610
00:39:28,955 --> 00:39:30,822
Whoa, save yourself!

611
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,258
I'll take care of this.

612
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:35,727
Oh.

613
00:39:36,495 --> 00:39:37,729
Not my fault, Astrid.

614
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:40,732
I got distracted
by the light in your eyes.

615
00:40:09,662 --> 00:40:13,032
Wait! Just let me...

616
00:40:29,515 --> 00:40:30,916
Yes. Well done, Astrid.

617
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,151
Nothing like giving them

618
00:40:32,251 --> 00:40:33,785
a taste of
their own medicine, eh?

619
00:40:33,886 --> 00:40:36,722
Also, "Well done, Snotlout,

620
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:38,224
with the assist," right?
What a team!

621
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:40,726
Is anyone taking this
seriously?!

622
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:42,695
Take it seriously.

623
00:40:42,794 --> 00:40:44,397
'Cause in case you forgot,
our parents' war

624
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,065
is about to become ours!

625
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:53,072
Figure out which side you're on.

626
00:41:42,288 --> 00:41:43,789
Hmm? Huh?

627
00:42:15,388 --> 00:42:18,157
Huh. Toothless.

628
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,160
I could've sworn you had...

629
00:42:23,596 --> 00:42:25,030
...teeth.

630
00:42:29,235 --> 00:42:31,604
I don't have any more.

631
00:42:53,426 --> 00:42:54,560
Thanks?

632
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:05,204
Oh, come on.
You're kidding, right?

633
00:43:19,418 --> 00:43:20,586
Mmm.

634
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:24,056
Hmm?

635
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:05,277
<i>And then</i>
<i>he turned and grabbed me arm,</i>

636
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:07,513
and with one twist,

637
00:47:07,646 --> 00:47:11,051
he took my hand clean off
and he swallowed it whole.

638
00:47:11,151 --> 00:47:12,818
Yeah, he must have spread
the word around,

639
00:47:12,886 --> 00:47:16,221
'cause within a month,
another one had taken my leg.

640
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:17,857
Probably a Skrill.

641
00:47:17,957 --> 00:47:20,526
Serrated teeth, jaw strength 17.

642
00:47:20,626 --> 00:47:23,029
I'll avenge
your fallen limbs, big guy.

643
00:47:23,096 --> 00:47:24,363
I'll chop off the hands and feet

644
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:27,199
-of every dragon that I see.
-Nah.

645
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:30,502
It's the wings
and the tail you want.

646
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:33,439
If they can't fly,
they can't get away.

647
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:36,341
A downed dragon
is a dead dragon.

648
00:47:36,442 --> 00:47:39,344
Anyone can get by
without the other bits.

649
00:47:39,445 --> 00:47:40,813
I'm gonna lose all of my limbs.

650
00:47:40,846 --> 00:47:43,883
I volunteer Ruffnut
to lose at least one limb.

651
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:44,984
Huh?

652
00:47:45,085 --> 00:47:46,285
What?

653
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:47,686
We're twins.
Your pain is my pain.

654
00:47:47,753 --> 00:47:49,288
You're twins?

655
00:47:49,354 --> 00:47:51,657
Even our own mother
can't tell us apart.

656
00:47:51,724 --> 00:47:53,659
It's uncanny.

657
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:54,961
There we go.

658
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:56,996
Astrid's got the right idea.

659
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:59,231
Get your sleep while you can.

660
00:48:00,066 --> 00:48:01,567
Soon, Stoick will be back.

661
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:04,170
And one of you will be chosen
to kill the dragon.

662
00:48:04,336 --> 00:48:07,606
Question is: Who?

663
00:48:48,114 --> 00:48:49,448
Toothless!

664
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:52,684
Brought breakfast.

665
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:02,628
Huh? What do you think, bud?

666
00:49:02,728 --> 00:49:03,930
Okay.

667
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:07,699
We got some cod...

668
00:49:08,433 --> 00:49:10,170
...some salmon

669
00:49:10,302 --> 00:49:12,304
and a whole smoked eel.

670
00:49:12,404 --> 00:49:14,908
Whoa, uh, uh, uh...

671
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:16,943
No eel! Scratch the eel!

672
00:49:18,844 --> 00:49:22,282
Yeah, I, uh,
can't say I love it, either.

673
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:28,988
That's it.

674
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:31,124
Stick to the good stuff.

675
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:35,327
I'll just be back here,

676
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,864
minding my own business.

677
00:49:40,967 --> 00:49:42,568
Okay.

678
00:50:01,187 --> 00:50:04,356
Okay. Okay.

679
00:50:07,492 --> 00:50:10,296
Whew. Okay. Not bad.

680
00:50:10,395 --> 00:50:11,931
It could work.

681
00:50:11,998 --> 00:50:13,365
If it's... Whoa! Okay!

682
00:50:13,498 --> 00:50:16,002
Toothless, no! Oh, gods!

683
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:20,039
Toothless!

684
00:50:20,073 --> 00:50:21,074
Oh, gods!

685
00:50:32,118 --> 00:50:34,087
It's working!

686
00:50:34,254 --> 00:50:36,890
Yeah! Whoo!

687
00:50:43,263 --> 00:50:46,531
Yeah! Whoo!

688
00:50:46,598 --> 00:50:48,767
<i>Today is all about teamwork.</i>

689
00:50:48,868 --> 00:50:53,039
If you work together,
you might just survive.

690
00:50:54,173 --> 00:50:58,510
You see, a wet dragon head
cannot light its fire.

691
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:01,080
But a Hideous Zippleback
is extra tricky,

692
00:51:01,214 --> 00:51:04,449
'cause one head breathes gas
and the other head lights it.

693
00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:08,021
Your job is to know
which is which.

694
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:09,255
Good luck.

695
00:51:12,491 --> 00:51:16,728
Razor-sharp fangs that inject
venom for predigestion.

696
00:51:16,762 --> 00:51:19,564
-Prefers to keep its victims...
-Shh!

697
00:51:19,598 --> 00:51:20,867
...conscious.

698
00:51:21,034 --> 00:51:23,970
You know, I'm kind of glad
we got partnered.

699
00:51:25,204 --> 00:51:27,673
Us girls got to stick together.

700
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:29,775
-Until I have to take you out.
-Shush.

701
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:31,743
I think I've
pretty much won Astrid over.

702
00:51:31,843 --> 00:51:33,545
I mean, she can barely even
look at me.

703
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:36,382
You came
to the right man for advice.

704
00:51:36,515 --> 00:51:37,917
-I didn't ask...
-If there's one thing

705
00:51:38,017 --> 00:51:40,585
the Viking girl brain
can't resist, it's...

706
00:51:40,686 --> 00:51:42,088
Look out!

707
00:51:43,822 --> 00:51:46,326
-Hey!
-It's us, geniuses.

708
00:51:46,392 --> 00:51:47,459
Lightning reflexes.

709
00:51:47,492 --> 00:51:48,995
I see hideous heads, I strike.

710
00:51:49,162 --> 00:51:51,030
Ow.

711
00:51:51,097 --> 00:51:52,365
Whoa.

712
00:51:52,464 --> 00:51:54,167
Uh, make that
one hideous head, Astrid.

713
00:51:58,404 --> 00:52:00,907
Save yourselves!

714
00:52:01,506 --> 00:52:03,475
Also known
to toy with its victims,

715
00:52:03,608 --> 00:52:05,278
dismembering them
limb from limb.

716
00:52:05,378 --> 00:52:07,846
Will you please stop that?

717
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:11,017
Fishlegs!

718
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:15,388
Wrong head.

719
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:20,726
Get out of there, Hiccup!

720
00:52:22,261 --> 00:52:23,695
Oh, come on.

721
00:52:34,073 --> 00:52:36,109
Yeah. Back!

722
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,946
Run... Hiccup.

723
00:52:40,113 --> 00:52:42,581
Don't make me
tell you again! Yeah.

724
00:52:42,714 --> 00:52:45,051
Yeah, that's right.
Back in your pen.

725
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:50,490
Now, think about
what you've done.

726
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:11,777
So, are we done today?

727
00:53:11,843 --> 00:53:15,214
J-Just because I have
some things I need to, uh...

728
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:18,184
Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna
see you guys tomorrow.

729
00:53:26,025 --> 00:53:26,993
Huh?

730
00:53:28,428 --> 00:53:29,996
Hey.

731
00:53:30,129 --> 00:53:31,264
Oh, come on.

732
00:53:31,397 --> 00:53:32,831
Just try it.

733
00:53:43,009 --> 00:53:44,576
Whoa!

734
00:53:44,676 --> 00:53:46,678
Oh, I'm gonna die!

735
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:49,681
Whoa, whoa, no!

736
00:53:51,317 --> 00:53:52,485
No, please!

737
00:53:52,584 --> 00:53:55,354
Just kind of angle yourself.

738
00:53:55,488 --> 00:53:57,823
Whoa!

739
00:54:01,227 --> 00:54:03,129
Whoa, whoa, no!

740
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:07,333
Oh, come on!

741
00:54:22,814 --> 00:54:24,584
-Out of my way.
-Move!

742
00:54:24,683 --> 00:54:25,952
Move, move, move,
move, move, move!

743
00:54:25,985 --> 00:54:27,887
Watch yourselves.
Get in its blind spot.

744
00:54:27,987 --> 00:54:29,621
I got it! It's mine!

745
00:54:29,688 --> 00:54:31,324
No, don't bring it over here!

746
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,972
Uh, little guy.
What is his name again?

747
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:48,341
-I don't remember.
-Hey. Slow down.

748
00:54:48,441 --> 00:54:50,076
-Are you trying to show us up?
-N-No.

749
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:51,944
I've never seen someone
take down a Gronckle like that.

750
00:54:52,044 --> 00:54:53,845
I mean, I do it all the time,
but how did you learn?

751
00:54:53,946 --> 00:54:55,915
Learn what?
What exactly was that?

752
00:54:56,048 --> 00:54:58,084
Okay, see,
I-I'd love to explain.

753
00:54:58,217 --> 00:55:00,785
It's just, I left my axe
back in-in the ring.

754
00:55:00,852 --> 00:55:02,555
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

755
00:55:02,654 --> 00:55:04,524
Whoa, okay.

756
00:55:04,656 --> 00:55:06,592
Yeah, yeah? You itchy?

757
00:55:06,758 --> 00:55:08,461
Is that the spot?

758
00:55:43,196 --> 00:55:44,829
Hiccup.

759
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,669
Yo, there he is.

760
00:55:49,734 --> 00:55:51,736
Hey, Hiccup.

761
00:55:51,836 --> 00:55:53,272
-Okay.
-Hiccup. W-W-Wait.

762
00:55:53,372 --> 00:55:55,174
-I have a proper question.
-So I'm thinking that...

763
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:57,476
All it needs to be
is you and me in the ring.

764
00:56:06,452 --> 00:56:08,221
A Terrible Terror!

765
00:56:15,928 --> 00:56:17,363
It's like the size of my...

766
00:56:18,598 --> 00:56:19,831
Get it off!

767
00:56:19,899 --> 00:56:21,867
Get it off! Get it off!

768
00:57:48,854 --> 00:57:50,923
Ow.

769
00:58:05,571 --> 00:58:07,239
And the other ships?

770
00:58:19,452 --> 00:58:21,187
Dad!

771
00:58:21,287 --> 00:58:22,221
I got it.

772
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:24,757
I missed you.

773
00:58:24,857 --> 00:58:26,892
In, like, a super manly way.

774
00:58:26,992 --> 00:58:29,095
I got so much to tell you
about the Trial of Flame.

775
00:58:29,161 --> 00:58:31,864
It's basically between... Dad?

776
00:58:32,732 --> 00:58:34,266
Dad?

777
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:36,602
Da...

778
00:58:36,702 --> 00:58:38,637
Okay, I'll see you at home.

779
00:58:38,738 --> 00:58:40,673
So, no nest, then?

780
00:58:40,773 --> 00:58:43,609
Not even close.

781
00:58:43,709 --> 00:58:45,544
I hope you had more success.

782
00:58:45,611 --> 00:58:46,912
Well, if by success,

783
00:58:47,012 --> 00:58:48,714
you mean your parenting
troubles are over,

784
00:58:48,781 --> 00:58:51,250
then, uh, yeah.

785
00:58:52,385 --> 00:58:54,120
Did you hear the news, Chief?

786
00:58:54,153 --> 00:58:56,956
-Everyone is so relieved.
-Good riddance to old Hiccup.

787
00:58:57,056 --> 00:58:58,724
Aye.

788
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:00,893
No one will miss that nuisance.

789
00:59:02,863 --> 00:59:05,398
Hiccup is...

790
00:59:05,531 --> 00:59:06,532
gone?

791
00:59:06,665 --> 00:59:08,100
Yeah.

792
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,369
Yeah, most afternoons,
but who can blame him?

793
00:59:10,436 --> 00:59:12,304
The life of a celebrity
can be very rough.

794
00:59:12,405 --> 00:59:14,140
He can barely walk
through the village

795
00:59:14,206 --> 00:59:16,877
without being swarmed
by his army of new fans.

796
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,881
Who would've thought
he has this...

797
00:59:20,913 --> 00:59:23,916
way with the beasts?

798
00:59:35,661 --> 00:59:36,929
All right, bud.

799
00:59:37,096 --> 00:59:39,465
We're gonna take this
nice and slow.

800
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:42,768
Here we go.

801
00:59:42,835 --> 00:59:43,904
Position three.

802
00:59:43,969 --> 00:59:46,038
Uh, no, four.

803
01:00:01,787 --> 01:00:03,322
You ready?

804
01:00:17,803 --> 01:00:19,638
Come on. Come on.

805
01:00:35,654 --> 01:00:37,690
Yeah, look at us!

806
01:00:37,756 --> 01:00:40,559
Whoa!

807
01:00:41,093 --> 01:00:43,529
My fault. My fault.

808
01:00:43,629 --> 01:00:45,498
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

809
01:00:45,598 --> 01:00:46,999
Position five.

810
01:00:49,903 --> 01:00:51,403
Come on, bud.

811
01:00:55,741 --> 01:00:57,978
Yeah. Go, baby!

812
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,980
Oh, this is amazing!

813
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:02,014
The wind in my...

814
01:01:02,081 --> 01:01:04,550
Cheat sheet! Stop!

815
01:01:08,855 --> 01:01:11,858
Oh, gods!

816
01:02:19,859 --> 01:02:21,061
Yeah!

817
01:02:33,006 --> 01:02:34,040
Son!

818
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:35,407
Dad! Uh, you're back.

819
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:37,944
Uh, uh, oh...
Okay, uh, Gobber's not here,

820
01:02:37,978 --> 01:02:40,245
-so, um...
-I know.

821
01:02:42,615 --> 01:02:44,116
Came looking for you.

822
01:02:44,216 --> 01:02:46,752
You-you-you did? Uh, wh-why?

823
01:02:46,852 --> 01:02:48,621
You've been keeping secrets.

824
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:50,356
I have?

825
01:02:50,456 --> 01:02:53,792
Just how long did you think
you could hide it from me?

826
01:02:54,293 --> 01:02:55,728
I-I don't even know
what you're talking...

827
01:02:55,828 --> 01:03:01,634
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.

828
01:03:03,135 --> 01:03:08,173
So, let's talk
about that dragon.

829
01:03:08,273 --> 01:03:09,876
Oh, gods, Dad.

830
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:11,878
I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry.

831
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:13,245
I-I was gonna tell you sooner.

832
01:03:13,345 --> 01:03:15,015
I just didn't know...

833
01:03:20,419 --> 01:03:22,856
You're not upset?

834
01:03:22,989 --> 01:03:25,025
What? What?

835
01:03:25,157 --> 01:03:27,159
I was hoping for this.

836
01:03:27,292 --> 01:03:29,095
-You were?
-Oh, yes.

837
01:03:29,194 --> 01:03:32,098
And believe me,
it only gets better.

838
01:03:32,197 --> 01:03:34,366
Just wait till you spill

839
01:03:34,433 --> 01:03:36,468
a Nadder's guts
for the first time.

840
01:03:36,535 --> 01:03:41,674
Or-or mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear.

841
01:03:41,774 --> 01:03:43,509
What a feeling.

842
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:46,079
You really had me
going there, son.

843
01:03:46,178 --> 01:03:49,848
All those years
of the worst Viking

844
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:52,085
Berk has ever seen.

845
01:03:52,184 --> 01:03:54,054
Odin, it was rough.

846
01:03:54,186 --> 01:03:55,654
I almost gave up on you.

847
01:03:55,688 --> 01:03:59,025
And all the while,
you were holding out on me.

848
01:04:00,093 --> 01:04:02,327
Thor almighty.

849
01:04:02,428 --> 01:04:04,530
Who would have thought
that dragon training

850
01:04:04,596 --> 01:04:07,533
would have been
your place to shine, huh?

851
01:04:07,633 --> 01:04:10,803
Ah, you might even win
Top Slayer.

852
01:04:10,937 --> 01:04:12,204
Just like your old man.

853
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:14,174
Who knows?

854
01:04:14,206 --> 01:04:15,641
You know...

855
01:04:15,674 --> 01:04:18,011
with you doing so well
in the ring...

856
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:19,845
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

857
01:04:19,946 --> 01:04:21,147
-Sit.
-Okay.

858
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,184
We finally have something
to talk about.

859
01:04:31,724 --> 01:04:33,492
So, I...

860
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:46,371
Oh! Oh, I, uh...

861
01:04:46,505 --> 01:04:48,908
I brought you something...

862
01:04:49,008 --> 01:04:51,310
to... to, uh...

863
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:54,646
keep you safe in the ring.

864
01:04:56,849 --> 01:04:59,886
Your mother would have
wanted you to have it.

865
01:05:00,954 --> 01:05:02,989
W-Wow. Uh, thanks.

866
01:05:03,022 --> 01:05:04,858
It's half of her breastplate.

867
01:05:06,126 --> 01:05:08,094
Matching set.

868
01:05:08,228 --> 01:05:10,496
Keeps her...

869
01:05:10,562 --> 01:05:12,798
It keeps her close, you know?

870
01:05:14,901 --> 01:05:16,435
Wear it proudly, son.

871
01:05:16,535 --> 01:05:19,638
You've held up
your end of the deal.

872
01:05:24,177 --> 01:05:25,544
Yeah.

873
01:05:25,711 --> 01:05:28,280
-Yeah. Tired.
-Yeah, I'm gonna...

874
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,282
-I'm gonna get some s-sleep.
-Uh, good talk.

875
01:05:30,349 --> 01:05:31,750
-Big day tomorrow.
-Yeah.

876
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:33,318
The Trial of Flame,
and it takes a lot out of you.

877
01:05:33,418 --> 01:05:34,853
Yeah, Trial of Flames--
Flame.

878
01:05:34,954 --> 01:05:36,722
-Good luck with that.
-Yeah, thank you, thank you

879
01:05:36,822 --> 01:05:38,057
-for the, uh... the breast hat.
-I hope you like the...

880
01:05:38,158 --> 01:05:40,592
-Hat. Yeah.
-Yeah.

881
01:05:40,626 --> 01:05:43,695
Okay, well...
good night.

882
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:53,940
No more of your tricks.

883
01:05:54,073 --> 01:05:56,408
-I'm taking Top Slayer today.
-Yeah, yeah, okay.

884
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:58,945
It's-it's all yours.
Top-Top Slay away.

885
01:05:59,078 --> 01:06:00,280
Sorry.

886
01:06:22,434 --> 01:06:25,004
Last chance. Make it count.

887
01:06:31,277 --> 01:06:32,611
Come on!

888
01:06:32,711 --> 01:06:34,881
-Go on, Astrid! You got it!
-Come on, Hiccup!

889
01:06:34,948 --> 01:06:37,449
-Go on!
-Come on!

890
01:06:41,087 --> 01:06:42,387
No!

891
01:06:42,487 --> 01:06:45,124
Son of a half-troll,
rat-eating...

892
01:06:45,258 --> 01:06:46,960
Glad to see
she's handling it gracefully.

893
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:48,727
You!

894
01:06:52,332 --> 01:06:54,733
Uh, okay.

895
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,435
-Later.
-Hey, hey. Not so fast.

896
01:06:56,535 --> 01:06:57,669
-Quiet down.
-No, I can't.

897
01:06:57,769 --> 01:06:59,172
-I'm gonna be late for, uh...
-What?

898
01:06:59,272 --> 01:07:00,606
Late for what, exactly?

899
01:07:00,706 --> 01:07:01,807
Another year...
-Shut up.

900
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,475
...and another Trial of Flame

901
01:07:03,542 --> 01:07:05,311
has come to an end.

902
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:08,747
Elder Gothi has made
her decision.

903
01:07:10,682 --> 01:07:15,654
The new Top Slayer will be...

904
01:07:36,808 --> 01:07:39,279
You've done it, Hiccup.

905
01:07:39,379 --> 01:07:41,180
You won the Trial of Flame.

906
01:07:41,247 --> 01:07:42,382
You get to kill the dragon.

907
01:07:42,447 --> 01:07:44,516
That's my boy!

908
01:07:48,154 --> 01:07:51,423
Hiccup, you won!

909
01:07:53,326 --> 01:07:55,895
Whoa! Yeah.

910
01:07:55,995 --> 01:07:57,297
Hooray me.

911
01:07:57,397 --> 01:07:59,198
I can't wait to...

912
01:07:59,299 --> 01:08:01,367
Beat it and never come back.

913
01:08:01,466 --> 01:08:03,369
All right, bud. Time's up.

914
01:08:03,502 --> 01:08:05,238
My thoughts exactly.

915
01:08:05,338 --> 01:08:07,273
Wh-What are you, uh...

916
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,309
What are you doing here?

917
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:11,177
-Looking for answers.
-Huh?

918
01:08:11,311 --> 01:08:12,444
What are you doing here?

919
01:08:12,577 --> 01:08:14,347
Who's Bud? Your trainer?

920
01:08:14,446 --> 01:08:15,614
Did he dress you up in this?

921
01:08:15,714 --> 01:08:17,649
Uh, I-I know
this looks suspicious,

922
01:08:17,749 --> 01:08:19,785
but f-funnily enough, I, uh...

923
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:22,288
Uh, you're right!
You're right. I, uh...

924
01:08:22,422 --> 01:08:23,655
I'm through with the lies.

925
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:26,292
I've been making outfits,
so, um, you got me.

926
01:08:26,426 --> 01:08:27,293
It's time everybody knew.

927
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:28,928
Just take me back.

928
01:08:29,028 --> 01:08:30,430
Ow!

929
01:08:30,495 --> 01:08:31,563
Why would you do that?

930
01:08:31,596 --> 01:08:33,132
That's for the lies.

931
01:08:34,499 --> 01:08:36,835
And that's for everything else.

932
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:40,273
Oh, no.

933
01:08:40,306 --> 01:08:42,474
Run. Run!

934
01:08:42,574 --> 01:08:43,775
No! No.

935
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:45,912
-What...
-Toothless, no!

936
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:46,745
Stop. It's okay.

937
01:08:46,778 --> 01:08:49,748
She's a friend. She's a friend.

938
01:08:53,953 --> 01:08:57,190
Toothless, Astrid.
Astrid, Toothless.

939
01:08:57,323 --> 01:09:00,492
The, uh... the Night Fury.

940
01:09:05,965 --> 01:09:07,867
I wouldn't.

941
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:13,873
We're dead.

942
01:09:15,707 --> 01:09:18,311
Hey. Where do you think
you're going?

943
01:09:49,008 --> 01:09:51,743
Hiccup! Get me down from here!

944
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,745
You have to give me
a chance to explain.

945
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:56,215
I'm not listening to anything
you have to say.

946
01:09:56,282 --> 01:09:58,117
Then I won't speak.

947
01:09:58,184 --> 01:10:00,119
Just let us show you.

948
01:10:00,186 --> 01:10:02,088
Please, Astrid.

949
01:10:13,466 --> 01:10:15,068
What is this?

950
01:10:15,168 --> 01:10:17,203
Uh, it's my design.

951
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:20,206
Yeah.
Pretty much the cocaptain.

952
01:10:22,475 --> 01:10:24,944
Then let's get this over with.

953
01:10:25,677 --> 01:10:26,778
You got it.

954
01:10:26,879 --> 01:10:30,116
Toothless, let's take her down.

955
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:32,985
Gently.

956
01:10:33,752 --> 01:10:35,555
Nothing to be afraid of.

957
01:10:42,361 --> 01:10:43,963
Oh, nice touch!

958
01:10:47,599 --> 01:10:48,901
I thought you were
his cocaptain!

959
01:10:49,035 --> 01:10:51,571
I am! It's a temporary
dragon malfunction!

960
01:10:55,141 --> 01:10:57,376
We worked out a whole system,
remember?

961
01:10:59,178 --> 01:11:01,981
If we survive,
I'm gonna kill you!

962
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:07,887
And now the spinning.

963
01:11:07,987 --> 01:11:11,424
Thank you for nothing,
you useless reptile.

964
01:11:11,524 --> 01:11:14,060
Please just make it stop.

965
01:11:15,194 --> 01:11:17,829
I'm clearly not
the one in control.

966
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:19,465
Then I'm sorry!

967
01:11:19,532 --> 01:11:22,268
Toothless, I'm sorry!

968
01:13:04,503 --> 01:13:06,105
Fine.

969
01:13:07,607 --> 01:13:09,375
You made your point.

970
01:13:11,577 --> 01:13:14,981
It doesn't change the fact
you have to kill one tomorrow.

971
01:13:16,748 --> 01:13:18,117
But if we can change
your mind...

972
01:13:18,251 --> 01:13:19,318
What?

973
01:13:19,385 --> 01:13:21,887
You gonna take everyone up
for a magical ride?

974
01:13:24,523 --> 01:13:27,994
It won't erase what they've
done to us, Hiccup.

975
01:13:28,661 --> 01:13:30,630
They hunt us, steal our food.

976
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:32,231
And one of them took my mom.

977
01:13:32,298 --> 01:13:34,233
But do we just keep
killing one another?

978
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:36,269
As opposed to...?

979
01:13:36,369 --> 01:13:38,271
I-I don't know.

980
01:13:39,572 --> 01:13:43,276
But you botched our escape plan,
so I'm gonna need a minute.

981
01:13:46,946 --> 01:13:50,883
Well, I might not snitch on you.

982
01:13:51,917 --> 01:13:54,320
And we might not
drop you in the sea.

983
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:00,760
Bud? What's up?

984
01:14:00,893 --> 01:14:02,561
What is it?

985
01:14:02,695 --> 01:14:05,164
Hey. Hey.

986
01:14:06,365 --> 01:14:07,400
Get down!

987
01:14:09,969 --> 01:14:13,039
Toothless, get us out of here.

988
01:14:18,144 --> 01:14:20,980
It looks like they're
hauling in their kill.

989
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,316
Then what does that make us?

990
01:14:59,085 --> 01:15:01,387
The dragons' nest.

991
01:15:02,455 --> 01:15:04,990
Oh, what my dad wouldn't give
to find this.

992
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:40,426
What is that?

993
01:15:43,629 --> 01:15:44,997
All right, bud, time to go.

994
01:15:53,572 --> 01:15:56,642
I can't believe it took
this long to figure it out.

995
01:15:56,776 --> 01:15:58,879
It all makes sense now.

996
01:15:59,011 --> 01:16:01,313
It's like a giant beehive.

997
01:16:01,414 --> 01:16:03,749
They're the workers,
and that's their queen.

998
01:16:03,884 --> 01:16:05,351
Their alpha.

999
01:16:05,451 --> 01:16:06,852
It controls them.

1000
01:16:06,952 --> 01:16:08,487
We got to find your dad.

1001
01:16:08,521 --> 01:16:09,922
No, no, no, not yet.

1002
01:16:10,055 --> 01:16:13,292
They'll...
they'll kill Toothless.

1003
01:16:14,527 --> 01:16:19,165
Astrid, we have to think
this through carefully.

1004
01:16:21,233 --> 01:16:24,970
Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons' nest,

1005
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:27,106
and you want
to keep it a secret?

1006
01:16:27,173 --> 01:16:29,575
To protect your pet dragon?

1007
01:16:30,576 --> 01:16:32,478
Are you serious?

1008
01:16:33,512 --> 01:16:35,080
Yes.

1009
01:16:44,457 --> 01:16:46,091
Okay.

1010
01:16:47,092 --> 01:16:49,962
Then... what do we do?

1011
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:55,668
Just give me until tomorrow.

1012
01:16:55,701 --> 01:16:57,470
I'll figure it out.

1013
01:17:00,039 --> 01:17:01,640
That's for kidnapping me.

1014
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,477
Hey, are you gonna...

1015
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,249
And that's for everything else.

1016
01:17:20,025 --> 01:17:22,863
What?

1017
01:17:33,205 --> 01:17:37,643
Well, I can finally show
my face in public again.

1018
01:17:41,714 --> 01:17:43,249
All right.

1019
01:17:43,382 --> 01:17:47,353
If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks,

1020
01:17:47,419 --> 01:17:52,424
Hiccup would've gone
from being, well, Hiccup...

1021
01:17:54,393 --> 01:17:57,463
...to placing first
in the Trial of Flame,

1022
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:59,431
I mean, I would've tied them
to a mast

1023
01:17:59,532 --> 01:18:02,401
and shipped them off
for fear they'd gone mad.

1024
01:18:02,501 --> 01:18:05,504
And you know it.

1025
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:10,409
But here we are.

1026
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:15,581
My son has won the title
of Top Slayer.

1027
01:18:16,883 --> 01:18:19,418
No one is more surprised...

1028
01:18:22,154 --> 01:18:25,324
...or more proud than I am.

1029
01:18:27,092 --> 01:18:31,830
Today, my boy becomes a warrior.

1030
01:18:31,932 --> 01:18:36,635
Today, he becomes one of us!

1031
01:18:36,669 --> 01:18:39,572
Yeah!

1032
01:18:39,705 --> 01:18:41,340
Yeah!

1033
01:18:42,308 --> 01:18:43,576
Yeah!

1034
01:18:44,577 --> 01:18:46,078
Yeah!

1035
01:18:46,178 --> 01:18:48,814
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1036
01:18:48,882 --> 01:18:51,216
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1037
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:55,021
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1038
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,058
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1039
01:18:58,123 --> 01:19:00,759
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1040
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,394
Hiccup! Hiccup!

1041
01:19:02,494 --> 01:19:05,230
Watch out for that dragon.

1042
01:19:06,632 --> 01:19:09,602
It's not the dragon
I'm worried about.

1043
01:19:11,737 --> 01:19:14,373
Look, I'm gonna try
to put an end to all this,

1044
01:19:14,473 --> 01:19:18,078
but if something goes wrong
in there, just...

1045
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:19,778
don't get involved.

1046
01:19:19,879 --> 01:19:22,114
My dad respects you too much.

1047
01:19:27,486 --> 01:19:28,888
Yeah.

1048
01:19:29,022 --> 01:19:30,991
But...

1049
01:19:31,091 --> 01:19:33,258
you have something I don't.

1050
01:19:34,094 --> 01:19:37,396
Something none of us have.

1051
01:19:38,898 --> 01:19:43,069
So... I'm going to stand by you,

1052
01:19:43,168 --> 01:19:45,237
come what may.

1053
01:19:48,041 --> 01:19:49,642
Come what may.

1054
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:53,145
It's time, Hiccup.

1055
01:19:56,883 --> 01:19:58,784
Knock him dead, son.

1056
01:20:09,294 --> 01:20:12,164
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1057
01:20:12,197 --> 01:20:16,002
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1058
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:18,905
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1059
01:20:18,938 --> 01:20:22,574
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1060
01:20:22,675 --> 01:20:25,011
Hiccup! Hiccup!

1061
01:20:25,078 --> 01:20:27,312
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1062
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:28,847
Go, Hiccup!

1063
01:20:28,948 --> 01:20:31,051
Show 'em everything
I taught you!

1064
01:20:31,151 --> 01:20:32,584
Should've been me.

1065
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,320
Whew. All right?

1066
01:20:35,454 --> 01:20:37,423
Good crowd, isn't it?

1067
01:20:37,523 --> 01:20:39,391
Hiccup! Hiccup!

1068
01:20:39,491 --> 01:20:43,562
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1069
01:20:57,077 --> 01:20:58,544
I would have gone
with the hammer.

1070
01:20:58,610 --> 01:21:01,213
Just-just give him a chance.

1071
01:21:08,654 --> 01:21:10,222
I'm ready.

1072
01:22:16,256 --> 01:22:18,690
What is he doing?

1073
01:22:20,059 --> 01:22:21,794
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1074
01:22:30,302 --> 01:22:33,305
I'm not one of them.

1075
01:22:45,484 --> 01:22:47,887
-Stop the fight.
-No.

1076
01:22:48,021 --> 01:22:49,822
You all need to see this.

1077
01:22:50,857 --> 01:22:52,959
They're not
what we think they are.

1078
01:22:54,426 --> 01:22:55,862
We don't have to kill them.

1079
01:22:57,396 --> 01:22:59,832
I said stop the fight!

1080
01:23:05,838 --> 01:23:08,407
Out of my way!

1081
01:23:08,807 --> 01:23:10,877
Get out of there, Hiccup!

1082
01:23:12,245 --> 01:23:13,880
Hiccup!

1083
01:23:33,732 --> 01:23:34,968
Quick, quick! Grab his hand!

1084
01:23:35,101 --> 01:23:36,635
-Climb up.
-Hiccup, grab my hand!

1085
01:23:36,735 --> 01:23:38,071
-Get up here!
-Hurry up!

1086
01:23:38,171 --> 01:23:39,471
Get over here, man!
Just grab his hand!

1087
01:23:48,014 --> 01:23:50,816
Astrid, get back here!

1088
01:23:50,884 --> 01:23:52,618
That's an order!

1089
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,361
Run!

1090
01:24:01,426 --> 01:24:03,395
Come on.

1091
01:24:06,065 --> 01:24:07,267
Hiccup!

1092
01:24:17,709 --> 01:24:20,779
Night Fury.

1093
01:24:21,713 --> 01:24:24,683
-Night Fury!
-He's real!

1094
01:24:52,145 --> 01:24:53,679
All right, bud. Go on. Go.

1095
01:24:56,648 --> 01:24:58,418
Go, go! Get to the side of him!

1096
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:03,522
Get out of the way, Hiccup!

1097
01:25:07,826 --> 01:25:09,295
No, stop.
You're only making it worse!

1098
01:25:11,364 --> 01:25:12,932
Astrid!

1099
01:25:16,468 --> 01:25:18,104
I got it. Go!

1100
01:25:20,173 --> 01:25:22,041
Stoick, he won't hurt you.

1101
01:25:32,051 --> 01:25:33,852
No!

1102
01:25:37,957 --> 01:25:40,026
Toothless!

1103
01:25:40,126 --> 01:25:41,160
Don't.

1104
01:25:44,663 --> 01:25:47,733
Take it down!

1105
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:49,501
Grab its legs!

1106
01:25:49,534 --> 01:25:50,870
-Hold it down!
-No!

1107
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:53,873
-No, don't hurt him!
-Stay back!

1108
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:00,645
And you...

1109
01:26:14,293 --> 01:26:16,062
Put it with the others.

1110
01:26:22,468 --> 01:26:23,702
-I should have known!
-Dad.

1111
01:26:23,735 --> 01:26:25,204
-I should have seen the signs.
-Dad!

1112
01:26:25,304 --> 01:26:26,339
We had a deal!

1113
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:28,207
I-I know, but that was before...

1114
01:26:28,307 --> 01:26:29,976
It's all so messed up.

1115
01:26:30,076 --> 01:26:34,546
So everything in the ring,
what, a-a trick? A lie?

1116
01:26:34,646 --> 01:26:36,648
No, I-I should have told you
before now.

1117
01:26:36,748 --> 01:26:38,550
Take that out on me--
it's my fault--

1118
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:40,920
but please don't hurt Toothless.

1119
01:26:42,121 --> 01:26:43,822
The dragon?

1120
01:26:43,956 --> 01:26:46,426
That's what you're
worried about?

1121
01:26:46,558 --> 01:26:48,560
Not the people
you almost killed?

1122
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:50,662
He's not dangerous.
He-he was protecting me.

1123
01:26:50,762 --> 01:26:54,566
They took your mother,
for gods' sake!

1124
01:26:55,734 --> 01:26:58,871
If she could see you now
standing there with them

1125
01:26:58,971 --> 01:27:00,839
when they've killed
hundreds of us.

1126
01:27:00,973 --> 01:27:02,774
And we've killed
thousands of them!

1127
01:27:02,875 --> 01:27:04,343
They defend themselves.

1128
01:27:04,444 --> 01:27:05,644
That's all.

1129
01:27:05,744 --> 01:27:06,979
They raid us
because they have to.

1130
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,580
If they don't bring
enough food back,

1131
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,949
they'll be eaten themselves.

1132
01:27:10,049 --> 01:27:11,817
There's something else
on their island.

1133
01:27:11,884 --> 01:27:13,553
A dragon like I've never seen.

1134
01:27:13,618 --> 01:27:15,720
Their island?

1135
01:27:17,323 --> 01:27:18,958
You've been to the nest.

1136
01:27:19,624 --> 01:27:21,394
Did I say nest?

1137
01:27:21,461 --> 01:27:23,396
How did you find it?

1138
01:27:23,496 --> 01:27:25,498
I didn't. Toothless did.

1139
01:27:25,597 --> 01:27:27,967
Only a dragon
can find the island.

1140
01:27:31,337 --> 01:27:33,805
No. Dad, no.

1141
01:27:33,906 --> 01:27:35,074
You don't know
what you're up against.

1142
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,609
This is nothing like
you've ever seen.

1143
01:27:37,742 --> 01:27:39,579
You can't win this one.

1144
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:41,047
For once in your life,
would you please

1145
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,982
just listen to me?

1146
01:27:46,953 --> 01:27:50,022
You've thrown your lot
in with them.

1147
01:27:51,491 --> 01:27:53,493
You're not one of us.

1148
01:27:53,593 --> 01:27:55,862
You're not my son.

1149
01:28:04,803 --> 01:28:06,339
Ready the ships!

1150
01:28:06,405 --> 01:28:08,740
We sail at dawn!

1151
01:28:37,702 --> 01:28:39,605
Forward on the leading line!

1152
01:28:39,704 --> 01:28:40,772
Swing it out slightly.

1153
01:28:40,839 --> 01:28:42,608
Here she comes. Easy.

1154
01:28:42,707 --> 01:28:45,178
Careful with the head.

1155
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:47,380
Oh, careful now.

1156
01:28:47,513 --> 01:28:49,515
Weapons loaded!

1157
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:50,950
Spare rigging aboard?

1158
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:53,352
-Aye.
-Hoist the sails!

1159
01:28:53,419 --> 01:28:55,054
Aye, Chief.

1160
01:28:57,722 --> 01:29:00,092
-Ready the oars.
-Aye, Stoick.

1161
01:29:01,327 --> 01:29:04,330
We set sail for Helheim's Gate!

1162
01:29:21,447 --> 01:29:23,549
Lead us home, devil.

1163
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:56,182
I tried to stop them.

1164
01:29:56,716 --> 01:29:59,151
I ended up giving them
exactly what they wanted.

1165
01:30:02,622 --> 01:30:04,523
I should've just...

1166
01:30:04,557 --> 01:30:07,759
I should've killed him when
I found him in those woods.

1167
01:30:09,761 --> 01:30:11,998
It would have been better
for everyone.

1168
01:30:12,131 --> 01:30:12,999
Yeah.

1169
01:30:13,099 --> 01:30:15,301
The rest of us
would have done it.

1170
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:19,438
So, why didn't you?

1171
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:21,773
-Why didn't you?
-I don't know.

1172
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,175
-I-I couldn't.
-That's not an answer.

1173
01:30:23,276 --> 01:30:25,211
Why is this so important to you
all of a sudden?

1174
01:30:25,311 --> 01:30:27,280
Because I want to remember
what you say right now.

1175
01:30:27,413 --> 01:30:29,315
For the love of...
Because I was weak.

1176
01:30:29,415 --> 01:30:30,950
Because I was a coward,
because I wouldn't

1177
01:30:31,117 --> 01:30:32,752
-kill a dragon.
-You said "wouldn't" that time.

1178
01:30:32,817 --> 01:30:34,887
Whatever! I wouldn't!

1179
01:30:34,954 --> 01:30:37,523
I'm the first Viking
in who knows how long

1180
01:30:37,657 --> 01:30:39,992
who wouldn't kill a dragon.

1181
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,462
First to ride one, though.

1182
01:30:49,368 --> 01:30:51,270
So?

1183
01:30:54,106 --> 01:30:56,409
I wouldn't kill him because...

1184
01:30:57,943 --> 01:31:00,246
...he looked
just as frightened as I was.

1185
01:31:03,582 --> 01:31:06,452
When I looked at him...

1186
01:31:06,552 --> 01:31:08,421
I saw myself.

1187
01:31:18,731 --> 01:31:20,966
Bet he's really frightened now.

1188
01:31:27,473 --> 01:31:29,208
What are you gonna do about it?

1189
01:31:29,308 --> 01:31:30,910
Eh.

1190
01:31:31,677 --> 01:31:33,312
Probably something stupid.

1191
01:31:33,412 --> 01:31:34,980
Hmm.

1192
01:31:35,014 --> 01:31:37,116
Well, you've already done that.

1193
01:31:42,621 --> 01:31:44,056
Then something crazy.

1194
01:31:45,591 --> 01:31:47,526
That's more like it.

1195
01:31:53,366 --> 01:31:54,900
Sound your positions.

1196
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,836
Stay within earshot.

1197
01:31:56,936 --> 01:31:59,038
One length to your stern.

1198
01:31:59,171 --> 01:32:01,474
On your starboard flank.

1199
01:32:01,607 --> 01:32:03,743
Why aren't they attacking?

1200
01:32:03,909 --> 01:32:06,145
Maybe they know
something we don't.

1201
01:32:09,115 --> 01:32:10,983
Are you just a glutton
for punishment or what?

1202
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:13,953
We have a fighting chance
this time.

1203
01:32:15,588 --> 01:32:17,690
Thanks to Hiccup.

1204
01:32:17,823 --> 01:32:19,291
How long
do you think we're gonna...

1205
01:32:19,392 --> 01:32:22,094
Shh.

1206
01:32:31,370 --> 01:32:33,506
Step aside, Drül.

1207
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:51,457
-Ship the oars!
-Oars in.

1208
01:33:04,804 --> 01:33:06,405
<i>Okay, wait.</i>

1209
01:33:06,505 --> 01:33:10,109
You just disgraced yourself
in front of the whole village.

1210
01:33:10,176 --> 01:33:12,144
-Why would we listen to you?
-'Cause I said so.

1211
01:33:12,244 --> 01:33:14,346
Exactly. Pay attention, gang.

1212
01:33:14,447 --> 01:33:17,216
Look, my dad means well,
but he's stubborn.

1213
01:33:17,316 --> 01:33:18,885
And he's about to be
way in over his head,

1214
01:33:19,051 --> 01:33:20,319
so it's up to us.

1215
01:33:20,419 --> 01:33:21,487
Us?

1216
01:33:21,587 --> 01:33:23,857
I can't pull this off
without you guys.

1217
01:33:24,023 --> 01:33:25,724
And you all have
something special to offer.

1218
01:33:25,825 --> 01:33:27,493
Say no more.

1219
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:31,297
You were wise to seek
the world's most deadly weapon.

1220
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:32,264
It's me.

1221
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:34,066
You've got a wild side,
and I like it.

1222
01:33:34,166 --> 01:33:35,067
Astrid, you're
our strongest fighter.

1223
01:33:35,134 --> 01:33:36,368
We need you to lead us.

1224
01:33:36,469 --> 01:33:38,804
Lead us where exactly?

1225
01:33:38,905 --> 01:33:42,241
They left
with every ship we have.

1226
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:46,245
Stick with me.

1227
01:33:50,449 --> 01:33:51,817
Oh.

1228
01:33:51,885 --> 01:33:54,353
That's where that went.

1229
01:33:54,453 --> 01:33:57,189
Stay low. Be ready.

1230
01:34:35,761 --> 01:34:37,563
We're here.

1231
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:56,715
No, uh-uh.

1232
01:34:57,783 --> 01:35:00,386
Hiccup, I...

1233
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:02,388
Relax.

1234
01:35:05,025 --> 01:35:06,091
It's okay.

1235
01:35:16,702 --> 01:35:18,637
Uh, where are you going?

1236
01:35:18,737 --> 01:35:20,941
You're gonna need
something to help you hold on.

1237
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:23,108
Get ready.

1238
01:35:23,142 --> 01:35:25,110
It's gonna be a long night.

1239
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:34,020
Form a defensive line.

1240
01:35:40,092 --> 01:35:42,561
Sharpen those axes, lads!

1241
01:35:50,603 --> 01:35:52,371
Chief.

1242
01:35:52,471 --> 01:35:54,239
Ready, Chief.

1243
01:35:55,174 --> 01:35:58,644
-Stand strong.
-Aye, Stoick.

1244
01:35:58,744 --> 01:36:02,181
-Make your people proud.
-We will, Stoick.

1245
01:36:04,084 --> 01:36:06,285
Today, we destroy

1246
01:36:06,385 --> 01:36:10,522
the reign of the dragon
once and for all.

1247
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:19,065
However this ends,
it ends right here, right now!

1248
01:36:20,532 --> 01:36:24,070
So let's send these devils
back to hell!

1249
01:37:42,082 --> 01:37:43,917
Is that it?

1250
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:45,185
The nest is ours!

1251
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:51,356
This isn't over.

1252
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:01,101
Get clear!

1253
01:38:01,201 --> 01:38:02,668
Fall back!

1254
01:38:02,701 --> 01:38:04,938
Fall back! Everyone, fall back!

1255
01:38:11,077 --> 01:38:12,311
Retreat!

1256
01:38:14,948 --> 01:38:16,448
Move!

1257
01:38:44,343 --> 01:38:46,645
Get to the ships!

1258
01:38:46,745 --> 01:38:47,881
No!

1259
01:39:00,692 --> 01:39:02,427
Get to the far side
of the island.

1260
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:04,363
Aye, Chief. Let's move!

1261
01:39:04,463 --> 01:39:06,966
This way! All of you!

1262
01:39:12,471 --> 01:39:14,439
-Get out of here, lads!
-Follow me!

1263
01:39:14,573 --> 01:39:16,276
Gobber, go with the others.

1264
01:39:16,408 --> 01:39:19,511
Why? Where are you going?

1265
01:39:26,585 --> 01:39:28,221
Actually,
I'm gonna stick around.

1266
01:39:28,288 --> 01:39:30,756
You've got that wild look
in your eye.

1267
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:33,725
I can buy them
some time if I give that thing

1268
01:39:33,893 --> 01:39:34,894
something to hunt.

1269
01:39:35,061 --> 01:39:36,695
And I can double that time.

1270
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:40,033
I know. I'm a big softy.

1271
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:43,802
Softest part of you
is your teeth.

1272
01:40:12,698 --> 01:40:16,135
Remember,
that thing is their queen.

1273
01:40:16,236 --> 01:40:17,636
They're inclined to do
whatever it says.

1274
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:19,939
We've got to help them
fight back.

1275
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:24,344
Fishlegs, what do we got?

1276
01:40:24,443 --> 01:40:27,280
Ooh, uh, heavily armored
skull and tail,

1277
01:40:27,446 --> 01:40:29,349
perfect for bashing
and crushing.

1278
01:40:29,514 --> 01:40:31,850
Small eyes, large nostrils.

1279
01:40:31,985 --> 01:40:33,953
Relies on hearing and smell.

1280
01:40:34,053 --> 01:40:36,655
-Got it. Astrid.
-Okay.

1281
01:40:36,755 --> 01:40:39,558
Snotlout, Fishlegs,
hang in its blind spot.

1282
01:40:39,691 --> 01:40:42,527
Make some noise.
Keep it confused.

1283
01:40:42,628 --> 01:40:45,164
Ruff, Tuff,
figure out its shot limit.

1284
01:40:45,265 --> 01:40:46,398
Make it mad.

1285
01:40:46,498 --> 01:40:48,800
That's our specialty!

1286
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:52,471
Try not to get killed, guys!

1287
01:41:02,315 --> 01:41:05,684
Uh, this thing doesn't have
a blind spot.

1288
01:41:09,188 --> 01:41:11,024
There!

1289
01:41:15,527 --> 01:41:17,897
Hey, bud.

1290
01:41:18,031 --> 01:41:19,332
I'm good.

1291
01:41:19,431 --> 01:41:21,267
Be careful.

1292
01:41:25,405 --> 01:41:28,174
I know, I know,
but I'm, uh... I'm here now.

1293
01:41:41,054 --> 01:41:42,688
Keep hammering!

1294
01:41:42,788 --> 01:41:45,524
But we're confusing
our own dragons!

1295
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:47,826
Oh, no!

1296
01:41:53,866 --> 01:41:55,435
This way!

1297
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,036
This way! Come on! Come on!

1298
01:41:57,136 --> 01:41:59,005
Guys, keep moving!
Keep moving! Come on!

1299
01:41:59,105 --> 01:42:00,106
Go!

1300
01:42:00,206 --> 01:42:01,773
Is that my kid?

1301
01:42:01,874 --> 01:42:04,377
-Snotlout!
-Come on! Throw it!

1302
01:42:06,645 --> 01:42:08,982
Whoa, girl.

1303
01:42:09,082 --> 01:42:10,749
Going down.

1304
01:42:13,186 --> 01:42:14,921
I'm okay.

1305
01:42:15,054 --> 01:42:17,156
Less okay.

1306
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:21,361
I got you, Fishlegs.

1307
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:31,536
What's wrong?

1308
01:42:31,603 --> 01:42:34,307
Got something in your eye?

1309
01:42:34,407 --> 01:42:37,642
Yeah! Now, that's a Top Slayer.

1310
01:43:57,356 --> 01:43:58,991
You got it, bud.

1311
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:06,199
Hiccup.

1312
01:44:08,733 --> 01:44:11,437
I was only trying
to protect you.

1313
01:44:11,571 --> 01:44:14,273
I know, Dad.

1314
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:16,142
Let me return the favor.

1315
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:20,812
Whatever happens up there,

1316
01:44:20,913 --> 01:44:24,884
I'm proud to call you my son.

1317
01:44:28,787 --> 01:44:30,289
And that's all I need.

1318
01:44:32,058 --> 01:44:33,159
Let's go.

1319
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:38,830
He's up!

1320
01:44:39,798 --> 01:44:41,700
You two, get Snotlout.

1321
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:43,369
I'll distract the queen.

1322
01:44:45,471 --> 01:44:48,707
That's right. Eyes on me.

1323
01:44:50,742 --> 01:44:51,944
Snotlout!

1324
01:44:55,515 --> 01:44:56,516
Now!

1325
01:44:56,681 --> 01:44:59,185
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

1326
01:45:05,892 --> 01:45:07,726
Whoa!

1327
01:45:12,532 --> 01:45:14,200
I can't believe that worked.

1328
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,435
Yeah.

1329
01:45:18,037 --> 01:45:20,739
No, no, no, girl.

1330
01:45:20,839 --> 01:45:23,442
Fight it! Don't listen to her!

1331
01:45:23,543 --> 01:45:25,144
Shake it off!

1332
01:45:49,535 --> 01:45:51,370
Astrid.

1333
01:46:06,485 --> 01:46:08,254
Did you get her?

1334
01:46:22,168 --> 01:46:23,269
Go.

1335
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:27,940
That thing has wings.

1336
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,142
Let's see if it can use them.

1337
01:46:45,524 --> 01:46:47,360
You think that did it?

1338
01:46:49,462 --> 01:46:50,896
Yep.

1339
01:47:05,978 --> 01:47:08,914
All right, bud.
It's time to disappear.

1340
01:47:14,053 --> 01:47:16,455
Here it comes!

1341
01:47:22,161 --> 01:47:25,131
Quite the chief you have
in the making there.

1342
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:26,265
Aye.

1343
01:48:07,406 --> 01:48:09,041
Watch out!

1344
01:48:12,712 --> 01:48:14,246
Okay, time's up.

1345
01:48:14,347 --> 01:48:16,248
Let's see if this works.

1346
01:48:21,354 --> 01:48:23,022
Is that all you've got?

1347
01:48:41,974 --> 01:48:43,676
Stay with me, bud!

1348
01:48:43,776 --> 01:48:45,478
Just a little bit longer!

1349
01:48:46,645 --> 01:48:48,347
Hold, Toothless!

1350
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:52,485
Now!

1351
01:49:14,373 --> 01:49:16,442
Yeah, bud, we... No!

1352
01:49:35,795 --> 01:49:38,063
Hiccup!

1353
01:49:42,368 --> 01:49:44,303
Hiccup?

1354
01:49:44,403 --> 01:49:46,005
Son?

1355
01:49:47,706 --> 01:49:49,542
Hiccup!

1356
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:06,358
Oh, son.

1357
01:50:18,704 --> 01:50:20,506
I'm so sorry.

1358
01:51:32,578 --> 01:51:34,313
Hiccup.

1359
01:51:42,221 --> 01:51:44,623
He's alive. He's alive!

1360
01:51:47,693 --> 01:51:49,395
Yeah!

1361
01:51:49,495 --> 01:51:51,397
Yes!

1362
01:52:02,107 --> 01:52:04,343
Thank you...

1363
01:52:05,110 --> 01:52:07,413
...for saving my son.

1364
01:52:08,581 --> 01:52:11,617
Well, you know...
most of him.

1365
01:52:27,733 --> 01:52:29,301
Hey, Toothless.

1366
01:52:31,071 --> 01:52:32,571
Okay.

1367
01:52:37,978 --> 01:52:39,645
I'm in my house.

1368
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:43,049
You-You're in my house.

1369
01:52:43,148 --> 01:52:45,751
D-Does my dad know you're here?

1370
01:52:45,851 --> 01:52:48,320
Oh, come on.

1371
01:53:36,036 --> 01:53:37,871
Thanks, bud.

1372
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:43,442
Okay, here we go.

1373
01:54:12,939 --> 01:54:14,640
Toothless, stay.

1374
01:54:18,277 --> 01:54:20,980
Hey, hey, hey!
Shouldn't you be in bed?

1375
01:54:22,481 --> 01:54:24,850
Okay. Hold on tight, guys.

1376
01:54:24,951 --> 01:54:27,153
Here we go.

1377
01:54:27,219 --> 01:54:29,254
Whoa, whoa!

1378
01:54:35,929 --> 01:54:37,362
Hey! Hey!

1379
01:54:37,529 --> 01:54:39,899
There you go!

1380
01:54:44,369 --> 01:54:47,706
-There he is! Oh, oh.
-Oh! Okay.

1381
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:50,642
So, what do you think?

1382
01:54:50,709 --> 01:54:53,113
A few changes
since you've been out.

1383
01:54:53,213 --> 01:54:56,983
Flying back here was, uh, quite
an experience, let me tell you.

1384
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:59,518
Wait, wait, you...
you rode a dragon?

1385
01:54:59,685 --> 01:55:01,320
Well... well,
that monster burned

1386
01:55:01,453 --> 01:55:02,855
all of our ships,
so we didn't really

1387
01:55:02,989 --> 01:55:04,289
-have much of a...
-Hiccup!

1388
01:55:04,389 --> 01:55:05,925
Oh, no.

1389
01:55:06,025 --> 01:55:07,861
What'd I do this time?

1390
01:55:07,961 --> 01:55:08,928
Ow!

1391
01:55:09,028 --> 01:55:10,295
That's for scaring me.

1392
01:55:10,462 --> 01:55:12,866
Okay, is it always gonna
be like this? 'Cause...

1393
01:55:15,567 --> 01:55:18,370
And that's for everything else.

1394
01:55:18,437 --> 01:55:21,207
You know, 'cause... 'cause I...
I-I could get used to that.

1395
01:55:21,306 --> 01:55:22,841
Yep.

1396
01:55:22,942 --> 01:55:27,947
Turns out all we needed
was a little more of this.

1397
01:55:28,915 --> 01:55:30,849
You just gestured to all of me.

1398
01:55:31,017 --> 01:55:33,719
Well, you know, most of you.

1399
01:55:33,786 --> 01:55:36,189
New leg is my handiwork
with just a dash

1400
01:55:36,288 --> 01:55:38,925
of your kooky flair
thrown in for good measure.

1401
01:55:39,025 --> 01:55:40,093
Here we go.

1402
01:55:40,193 --> 01:55:41,393
Welcome home.

1403
01:55:41,493 --> 01:55:42,996
-You rebuilt it?
-Yeah.

1404
01:55:43,062 --> 01:55:44,931
I found your designs.

1405
01:55:45,031 --> 01:55:46,365
Not too bad.

1406
01:55:46,498 --> 01:55:48,634
Night Fury!

1407
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:50,836
-Here he is.
-What is it?

1408
01:55:50,937 --> 01:55:52,504
What is it, huh?

1409
01:55:52,571 --> 01:55:54,807
Want to take it for a spin?

1410
01:56:05,417 --> 01:56:07,853
<i>This is Berk.</i>

1411
01:56:09,822 --> 01:56:11,858
<i>You'd have to be crazy</i>
<i>to move here.</i>

1412
01:56:13,492 --> 01:56:15,727
<i>Even crazier to stay.</i>

1413
01:56:17,629 --> 01:56:20,465
<i>It's not for the faint of heart.</i>

1414
01:56:23,937 --> 01:56:25,604
Whoo!

1415
01:56:25,704 --> 01:56:27,439
<i>Any food that grows here</i>

1416
01:56:27,539 --> 01:56:30,043
<i>is tough and tasteless.</i>

1417
01:56:30,109 --> 01:56:31,610
Come on!

1418
01:56:31,677 --> 01:56:33,445
<i>The people that grow here...</i>

1419
01:56:33,545 --> 01:56:35,081
-Whoa!
<i>-...are even more so.</i>

1420
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:42,487
<i>The only upsides are the pets.</i>

1421
01:56:42,554 --> 01:56:45,959
<i>While other places may have</i>
<i>ponies or puppies...</i>

1422
01:56:46,059 --> 01:56:49,195
-Come on, bud.
<i>-...we have...</i>

1423
01:56:52,098 --> 01:56:53,933
<i>...dragons.</i>
